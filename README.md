# Box Bot!
=======
Joshua Brown 2016

Imagine the Chaos and Destruction of [BattleBots](http://www.battlebots.com/) or [RoboGames](http://robogames.net/index.php)! Now imagine if they were all made out of cardboard,  ... and also under 1.5 pounds!  That is [Box Bots](https://www.acemonstertoys.org/box-bots/).  The intent of Box Bots is to make a robot fighting league in which you don't need to spend tens of thousands of dollars to play.  The season entry fee of $95 includes everything you need to fight, to the robot-death, in the Area of Resolution!  The fundamental engineering constraint, is the chassis material.  You may only use ONE (1) 4" X 6" C4-fluted, cardboard box to 'primarily' construct your chassis.  Each active component, that can exert a force or a torque, may only be connected to other active components with this cardboard.

This Arduino sketch is the on-board software for my as-yet-to-be-named box-bot.  The remote control radio receiver signals are interpreted by the code running on an Arduino Nano and output to a motor driver for a tank drive style platform.

The plan is to have two classes of fighting box-bots.  The 'Stock' or 'AMT Class' will be constructed from the parts that come in a kit provided by the price of admission to the season of box-bots.  It contains:

* 3 Channel Radio Transmitter with rechargeable battery
* 3 Channel Radio Receiver
* 7.4V 1000mah battery 20C JST connector
* Titan B3 2S 3S balance charger w/ power cord
* Robot Gear Motor â€“ TT Style 1:120 ratio (2)
* 65mm Robot Motor Wheel, rubber removable tire (2)
* TB6612 H-Bridge module 15V 1.2A Max
* Arduino Nano w/ CH430
* Custom BoxBot Control Board PCB
* DC-DC Step Up XL6009 Module
* Rocker Switch
* Googly Eyes (2)
* cardboard 6 x 8 C-flute box
* wooden ruler
* some wire, headers and terminals
* you may add up to $40 of stuff other than that, perhaps a weapon?

The 'Open Class' you may provide any or all of your own materials with the exception of the cardboard box.  That is the only chassis material you get!  You can't get muliple boxes and just make an impervious cube of solid cardboard.  But in the Open Class you may use higher performance motors, radios, etc.
